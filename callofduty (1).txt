Like every year, 
Call of Duty tries to satisfy all gamers, 
no matter what they are looking for. 
Solo adventure, multi-competitive, collaborative zombie, free-to-play battle royale. 
A turnkey offer, XXL menu style, which this year lacks care at launch. 
We see it through the countryside which despite its exoticism offers nothing exceptional or memorable to experience. 
This is also seen in Zombie Mode, 
which at launch is only a rough sketch of what it should be and unfortunately lacks content. 
In the equation, 
the multi comes out with its head held high, offering several well-felt new features and still lively gameplay. 
More and more turned towards the “live service” and the updates of season, 
Call of Duty signs, with Vanguard, an episode of end of cycle, 
which asks only to evolve to improve and which turns out to be more enjoyable overall than the overall experience of Black Ops Cold War.
